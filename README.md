![Weather Server Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e97939-ae13-40a0-9c1e-a6863cac5d87)

## ✨ Features

- Real-time NWS weather alerts by state

- Lightweight MCP protocol implementation
- Claude for Desktop integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- UV package manager (`>=0.1.0`)
- Claude for Desktop (`>=2.3.0`)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
uv add mcp[cli] httpx
```

2. Create `weather.py`:
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import httpx

mcp = FastMCP("weather")

@mcp.tool()
async def get_forecast(lat: float, lon: float):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}/forecast"
        )
        return response.json()
```

## 🔌 Claude Integration

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["weather.py"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project"
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Example Usage

```plaintext
User: What's the weather in San Francisco?
Claude: [Uses get_forecast(37.7749, -122.4194)]
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
